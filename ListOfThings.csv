Case-based reasoning,,Lazy Learner,,Less Training time,More prediction time,Supervised,,
Decision Tree,,Eager Learners,All the attributes should be categorical,Less Prediction time,More Training time,Supervised,Precision:,
,,,,,,,Recall:,
,,,,,,,Cross-Validation,
Naive Bayes,,Eager Learners,All the attributes are conditionally independent,Less Prediction time,1. More Training time,Supervised,,
,,,,,"2. Zero Probability problem: When the conditional probability is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed explicitly using a Laplacian estimator",,,
ANN,,Eager Learners,,1. Less Prediction time,1. More Training time,Supervised,Information Gain:,
